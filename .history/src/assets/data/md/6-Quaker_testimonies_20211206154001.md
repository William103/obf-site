# “Everything that is Required of Us:” Quaker Testimonies

The first printed Discipline of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting included separate sections on core eighteenth century Quaker testimonies: “Plainness,” “Negroes or Slaves,” and “War and Taxes therefor.”[^30]

## Plainness

Clearly – evidenced in his own journal as well as in the memorial written on his death – the plainness testimony was very important to Hunt. In the annual queries, Friends were advised to be “careful to bring up those under their direction in plainness of speech and apparel…” Ministers and elders were particularly advised to bring up their families in “plainness in dress, language, and true moderation.”[^31] Plainness was a testimony that went beyond clothing and house furnishing. Plainness of speech and address also meant that a Friend’s words and his relationships both among Quakers among the “world’s people” were to be clear and truthful.

Quaker dress was readily identifiable by Quakers and non-Quakers alike. But there were no detailed written instructions to say what was plain and what was not. The cut of men’s coats and the style of women’s bonnets became Quaker convention. Friends were left to discern what was plain and what was worldly, and practice varied over a wide spectrum of behavior. Could Friends wear metal shoe buckles, when a string would do? As an acknowledged minister, Hunt, more than most Friends, needed to set an example for himself and the wider community. In 1785 he noted [Jacob Lindley’s](/entities/w6xf1s5t/) speaking on the subject of Friends wearing “carved silver \[shoe] buckles and red, spotted handkerchiefs.”[^32]

Hunt wrote “Then let us begin to prepare and do everything that is required of us. I believe plainness of dress is required of us, plainness of dress is as a hedge about us; the world is not then seeking our company.”[^33] Plainness served as a hedge against the temptations of the non-Quaker world. But the danger of extreme plainness -- or singularity, setting oneself apart from the Quaker norm -- was that it could fuel individual pride. This is something that John Woolman struggled with. It was also something that the committee to deal with Joshua Evans’s beard was undoubtedly concerned with as well.

## Antislavery

As reflected in his journal entries, John Hunt was committed to the abolition of slavery and the promotion of human rights. He particularly admired [Joshua Evans’s](/entities/w6c82qz0) work on behalf of both Native Americans and African-Americans. At Evans’ death he observed that “this afternoon, fourth hour, was appointed to meet at the burial of Joshua Evans, and a vast concourse of people there was of different colors. The Negroes and Indians, for whom he had been a great advocate, testified their regard for him by attending his funeral, as well as the white people.”[^34] Quakers esteemed a long history of peaceful relations with the indigenous inhabitants of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the Lenni-Lenape. By 1770s, Native American communities in New Jersey were in need of material and spiritual support. On more than one occasion John Hunt and Joshua Evans took aid to those living on their reservation at Edgepelick, Burlington County:
>I went with my friend Joshua Evans to see the poor Indians at Edgepelick and we found them in a very low circumstance as to food and raiment. Joshua took them a considerable parcel of old clothes with which the poor naked children seemed exceedingly pleased.[^35]

Quakers were pioneers in the anti-slavery movement. Nevertheless it took several decades for Friends as a corporate body to reach the position that enslavement in any and all forms was incompatible with Quakerism and to finally require that all enslaved people held by Friends be liberated and that any Friend who refused to do so would be disowned. By 1780, slavery was virtually extinct among Friends. New Jersey nurtured the growing anti-slavery movement among Friends. [John Woolman (1720-1772)](/entities/w6wr0v4m/), [David Cooper (1725-1795)](/entities/w6qj9kc7/), and [Joshua Evans (1731-1798)](/entities/w6c82qz0) were among the most vocal proponents.

John Hunt served on a number of Quaker committees whose charge was to deal with members of the Society of Friends who had not yet freed their slaves. In 1776, for example, he was among those appointed to “treat with \[Jonathan Austen] and any other members that have slaves, in order if possible, to convince them of the inconsistency of holding them in bondage, and endeavor to procure suitable Learning for those that are children in order to qualify them for freedom justly due to them."[^36] Two years later he “went with a committee to visit Friends who still kept Negroes; and we obtained manumissions for most of the poor slaves kept by Friends of our monthly meeting; which was a very great satisfaction, after long waiting and much labor that had been spent with those who held them.”[^37]

Hunt also appointed meetings for worship in the local Black community and advocated for a regular service among them:
>The Consideration of appointing a Meeting for the Black people, likewise a Committee to particularly attend to the circumstances of that people being resumed...the Meeting appears united in appointing a Meeting for them at this place at the First Second day in next month, to begin at the usual Hours and the overseers and Elders of each Particular meeting are desired to attend the same. [John Collins](/entities/w6165774), [Abraham Warrington](/entities/w6vv2hqk), John Hunt, [Josa Lippincott](/entities/w6jb6xn6), [Enoch Evans](/entities/w6wt9jhx), [Samuel Allinson](/entities/w6058f0z), Joshua Owen, Joseph Sharp  are appointed a Standing Committee of this meeting to particularly attend to the accommodations of that people and report to this meeting from time to time as occasion might require.[^38]

[^38]: Evesham Monthly Meeting Minutes, October, 1783.  

He also served as a conduit between Philadelphia abolitionists and his African American neighbors:
>We attended the school house meeting appointed for the black people, and a favored good time it was. A week after this we were at Evesham, and had a meeting with the black people there. In both these meetings, an epistle directed to the black people, was read to them, issued from a convention of delegates of the abolition society, who met at Philadelphia. They were both satisfactory opportunities, in which Hannah Burrows, a colored woman, had good service, and spoke well on various matters mentioned in the epistle with great eminence.[^39]

Membership in the Society of Friends was not quickly or easily granted to African Americans. John Hunt was among those who advocated for equal access to membership. During the Yearly Meeting of 1796 he recorded:
>I was on several committees; one was concerning a case brought from Rahway, of a mulatto woman that had requested to be received amongst Friends; and of whom they gave a very favorable account, but could not unite in receiving her, on account of her color; so they brought the case to this Yearly Meeting….and it was unanimously agreed that there never was any discipline amongst Friends, to prohibit any from being received into membership on account of color or nation, whatsoever. We therefore reported to the Yearly Meeting, that monthly meetings should be considered at liberty to receive all such, when they were convinced of their sincerity, without distinction of nation or color: with which the meeting very heartily united. There was that felt which raised the testimony in this respect, above all opposition: notwithstanding the spirit of prejudice which had been imbibed on account of color, had kept it back above twenty years; within which time, divers black and mulatto people have requested to have a right among Friends; but till now have been put by, on account of their color.[^40]

## Peace

John Hunt’s strong belief in the peace testimony was reflected in his journal when he related the experience of his son, [Samme](/entities/w60h49sj/). In October 24, 1787, the latter was taken prison in Burlington, New Jersey, for refusing to pay a tax to defray the expense of war.  Hunt commented: “The constable took our son Samme off to gaol for refusing to pay his tax. He went of in a composed commendable manner, having I believe well considered the matter.” John and other Quakers went to Burlington to see his son and recorded that he “was favored to bear the trial in a proper commendable manner.” Samme was prepared to remain in prison, but his fine was paid by an unknown party, believed to be a Doctor Beneville.[^42]
