        <h1>Our Beloved Friend: The Journals of John Hunt</h1>
        <p>
        Since its origins in the 1650s, the Quaker community has encompassed a densely interconnected transatlantic network. Friendly Networks explores ways to describe Quaker identities, outline Quaker social networks, and connect them to archival sources, with a focus on the journals of New Jersey minister John Hunt (1740-1824). These journals, kept from 1770 to 1824, document not only Huntâ€™s daily activities and religious life but also his advocacy for non-violence, the end of slavery, and the fair treatment of Native Americans and African Americans.
