              Among Friends, meetings for worship, also called Particular
              Meetings, were organized on the principle of silent waiting, where
              each person could pray, meditate, or “listen to the Light of God.”
              They were usually held on First Day, the day we call Sunday, but
              could also occur mid week or as called. Vocal ministry arose when
              a member felt inwardly led to offer a specific message or prayer.
              Although anyone could be inwardly led, recorded ministers most
              frequently &nbsp;spoke aloud. It was not necessary to be a member
              to attend such a meeting. Men and women met together for worship.

              In the late 18th century, “General Meetings” (for worship) were
              appointed every three or four months to which children and
              servants were specifically invited. Separate Youth’s Meetings (for
              Worship) were also held. John Hunt and Joshua Evans, among others,
              also arranged for meetings for worship in the local Indigenous and
              African-American communities.

              Preparative Meetings generally oversaw the meetings for worship.
              It was, in effect, the local “congregation.” Men and women held
              separate business meetings (at all levels) until the late 19th
              century. The Preparative Meeting usually held the deeds to the
              land on which the meetinghouse and burial ground stood. Unlike
              many other Protestant denominations, the preparative meeting was
              constituted by the members who worshipped in a home or meeting
              house, not the building or church in which worship occurred.

              And the Preparative Meeting appointed representatives to attend
              the Monthly Meeting of which it was a part. The Monthly Meeting
              was the fundamental unit of Friends’ organization. It had
              responsibility for care of members, authorized removals and
              marriages, maintained discipline, considered queries, and reported
              regularly to the quarterly meeting. All business meetings (at all
              levels) were held in a spirit of worship, and so were in effect
              meetings for worship for conducting business. In theory, all
              members in good standing could participate in the monthly business
              sessions, but the representatives generally presented the business
              of the Preparative Meeting.{" "}

              Quarterly Meetings for business was held four times per year,
              attended by representatives of all monthly meetings in given area.
              It served as an appellate body for disciplinary matters and
              considered problems too large for a local meeting to solve. A
              quarterly meeting held the authority to establish or discontinue a
              monthly, preparative, or particular meeting for worship.

              Yearly Meeting was the highest level of authority within the
              Society of Friends, a large and autonomous body of Quakers in a
              particular geographic region. Decisions were binding on the
              monthly and quarterly meetings within its jurisdiction. It met
              annually over a period of several days to conduct business,
              formulate the discipline, receive reports and concerns from its
              constituent meetings, review the state of the Society, and to
              communicate with other yearly meetings through epistles. In Hunt’s

              In 1756, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting first appointed a Meeting for
              Sufferings to raise and administer relief to Friends who suffered
              distress as a result of Indian conflicts or governmental
              persecution. This body could act for the Yearly Meeting during the
