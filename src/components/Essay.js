              The remembrance of this our beloved friend, being precious amongst
              us, it is apprehended a brief account of him may be useful to

              It appear from memorandum which he left, that in his youth he was
              much inclined to vanity; but by yielding obedience to the
              “reproofs of instruction, which are the way of life,” he was
              induced to withdraw from such company as he had found to have a
              corrupting tendency; and by attention to this principle of divine
              grace, he was led to seek retirement, wherein his good desires
              were strengthened. &nbsp;He also found much consolation and
              encouragement in reading the scriptures and other religious books.
              &nbsp;Being careful diligently to attend meetings, his mind became
              exercised under an apprehension of duty to express a few words
              therein; and having at length yielded to these impressions, he
              experienced the reward of peace; and the expansion of his mind was
              such, that he felt love to flow toward all mankind in a manner he
              had never before witnessed. &nbsp;But when he again felt his mind
              drawn to a similar discharge of duty, he was induced to look for a
              greater evidence of its being a divine requiring, and to put it
              off from time to time for nearly a year, much to his own
              disadvantage. &nbsp;At length he gave up to the service, and
              continued to be engaged therein to the close of his days, being a
              minister about fifty years; and tho' his gospel labours were much
              about home, and at the neighbouring meetings, yet he made divers
              religious visits to Friends within the compass of our own, and the
              adjacent Yearly Meetings, to satisfaction.

            <span class="c41 c60">
              Being an example of plainness and simplicity, he also bore a
              public testimony against pride and superfluity, which he observed
              had increased to an alarming degree; frequently reviving the
              testimony of William Penn's father, viz. &nbsp;“Son William, if
              you and your friends keep to your plain way of preaching, and
              plain way of living you will make an end of the priests to the end
              of the world."

          <p class="c14">
            <span class="c41 c60">
              His concern for the promotion of temperance often induced him to
              labour with Friends and others, to discourage the customary use of
              ardent spirits.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p class="c14">
            <span class="c41 c60">
              His care for the rising generation led him frequently to visit
              schools, and on other occasions to use his endeavours to impress
              upon the minds of young people, the necessity of circumspection
              and watchfulness, That they might exercise a guarded care against
              the encroachments of corrupting customs and fashions: often
              expressing his anxiety that all might be excited to diligence in
              their respective duties, and to a due consideration of their
              latter end. &nbsp;His care to provide for his family, his punctual
              observance of contracts, and regular attention to engagements of a
              pecuniary nature, were evidences that he was governed by honest
              and upright principles. &nbsp;His diligence in attending religious
              meetings, his visits to those in affliction, his frequent
              religious labours at funerals, and at appointed meetings in places
              where they were not regularly held, manifested his ardent
              solicitude to be faithful in the discharge of his religious
              obligations. &nbsp;His gift in the ministry seemed to brighten
              near his close, directing all carefully to attend to "the
              unspeakable gift," or "light of Christ" in man, as being the only
              way to salvation; and which agrees also with Paul's testimony,
              "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
              men, teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
              should live soberly, righteously and godly, in this present
              world." And he frequently revived this observation, "That society
              or people which does not often recur to first principles will
              surely go to decay."
            </span>

              As a man, his passions were easily excited under cross
              occurrences; which, for want of a constant watch, sometimes
              prevailed so as to occasion subsequent distress and heart-felt
              sorrow. &nbsp;But at length he was mercifully favoured to
              experience, in respect to this "thorn in the flesh," the
              sufficiency of that grace which is perfect even in weakness.
              &nbsp;A few years before his death, a friend who had been with him
              through the night, encouraged him to seek after an increase of
              patience; in tears he exclaimed, "why this has always been my
              weakness, but I have, prayed unto the Lord and he has helped me."

              He was diligent and industrious, both in his domestic and
              religious services; and so intent was his mind on laying up
              treasure in heaven, and availing himself of the means of
              improvement, that in accordance with the advice of William Penn to
              his children, he kept a diary for more than forty years; besides
              which, he wrote several essays and many letters on moral and
              religious subjects, evincing his concern for the promotion of
              truth and righteousness amongst his fellow-creatures.

          <p class="c14">
            <span class="c41 c60">
              Though often labouring under bodily infirmities, he was generally
              able to attend meetings till near his close; and zealously
              encouraged others to faithfulness in the discharge of this duty,
              particularly in that part of the week wherein so much deficiency
              has been observed.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p class="c14">
            <span class="c41 c60">
              During his last illness he manifested much resignation, often
              saying "he hoped he might be enabled to bear patiently what the
              Lord might see meet to inflict." A friend calling to see him,
              observed he was sorry to find him so ill. &nbsp;He replied, "I
              have enjoyed more days of health than many have had;" and spoke of
              his dissolution with great composure; saying, "the words of John
              Woolman often occur, My dependence is on the Lord, who I trust,
              will forgive my sins, which is all I hope for." Thus, we have
              reason to believe he was favoured to witness redemption through
              Christ the eternal Word, and no doubt gained an admittance into
              that kingdom, where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the
              weary be at rest.

              Following William Penn’s advice, John Hunt kept a journal for over
              half a century, beginning in 1770 and ending shortly before his
              death in 1824. This original work, penned in his own hand, is in

              Part of the original document was given to Friends Historical
              Library in 1956. This portion consisted of an incomplete
              manuscript, 1812-1824, including two loose sheets from 1806 and
              1808, and 11 parts from 7mo7 1812 to 10mo10 1824. These were said
              to have been in the possession of Dr. Rachel Williams of
              Moorestown, New Jersey, and had been given by her to William Bacon
              Evans for him to convey to this Library. Rachel was the daughter
              of Jonathan G. and Susanna R. Williams, and Susanna was the
              Daughter of David and Rachel Hunt Roberts. The latter was a child
              of Joshua Hunt, John Hunt's half-brother.

              The earlier section of the original journal was traced to members

              Stackhouse. The latter had given permission for an excerpted
              publication to the New Jersey Historical Society in the 1930s. It
              was donated it to FHL in 2004. The part of Hunt’s journal from
              1776 to 1787 was originally bound with accounts dating from
              1769-1772; both of these were paginated, pages numbered 73-172 and
              51-72 respectively. It is unknown what, if anything, preceded page

              John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors,
              his punctuation, spelling and abbreviations were not standardized
              or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to
              produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the
              words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and
              capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of
              surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate
              searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are
              surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are
              also retained. &nbsp;“How art thou feeling” remains as written,
              not changed to “How are you feeling.” And Hunt frequently used the
              abbreviation “Do.” for ditto; this has not been changed. The word
              “sic.” means that word or words are transcribed as written.
              Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified
              by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James
              version, are footnoted. Where Hunt himself identified them as such
              this attribution is retained in the main body of the text. &nbsp;

              Hunt consistently uses Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the
              names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday,
              October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of
              the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by
              the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for
              ease of reading.{" "}

              Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound
              journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while
              he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single
              sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have
              added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically in the order
              in which they are listed in Appendix C. The end of a single page
              or of a longer bound section is marked with a note in square
              brackets and with a horizontal line.{" "}

              John Hunt was a Quaker minister from Burlington County, New
              Jersey. He was born in 1740 and died in 1824. At the age of thirty
              Hunt began keeping a daily journal and continued it until his
              death, a remarkable fifty-four years recording his everyday
              activities and intimate thoughts. While this journal is not a
              literary masterpiece, it does present extraordinary insights into
              his life and times.

              There is very little information about the first years of Hunt’s
              life. He was a birthright member of Evesham Monthly Meeting, the
              son of Robert Hunt and his first wife Abigail. The later printed
              version of Hunt’s journal contains a brief autobiographical
              fragment which is not included in the manuscript original:

              At divers times in my very youthful days, and particularly when
              about eight years of age, I was favored with the tendering
              visitations of Divine goodness; the effects of which were marked
              in my countenance and deportment, so as to attract the notice of
              my friends. And afterward as I grew up, and before I was of age, I
              used sometimes to seek places of retirement, and spend the
              afternoons of first-days in reading the scriptures and other
              religious books; refusing to go into company—and in so doing I
              felt the reward of peace. But not abiding in this tender watchful
              state, I gave way again and again, to go into unprofitable
              company; and sometimes spent the first-days in a way which brought
              trouble, and cost me many tears in solitary corners.{" "}

            <span class="c9">
              Begun in 1770, Hunt’s journal recorded his day to day work life,
              family events, his own spiritual state of mind and that of the
              meetings he attended, and local and national events.

              The bulk of the early entries revolve around farming his own
              property and working as a rural joiner. Interestingly, the journal
              also functioned as an account book, listing his customers and
              whether their accounts were current. Hunt turned wooden pumps of
              various sizes but also supplied plows, cradles, coffins, and
              benches, the usual products of a local craftsman. On the farm and
              in his shop he was sometimes aided by his sons, apprentices,
              indentured servants, and hired help. Patterns of work were
              dictated by the seasons. During September of 1770, for instance,
              he recorded days spent putting up an apple mill, trimming casks,
              making furniture, going to the mill, husking and hauling corn,
              splicing pumps, getting firewood, picking winter apples, and other
              regular chores.

              While the first years are largely an accounting of his working
              life, Hunt becomes increasingly interested in documenting his
              spiritual progress as well, a sort of confession of faith. He
              records his participation in what seems like an endless series of
              Quaker meetings for worship and for business. After he was
              recognized as a minister in 1783, his activities on behalf of the
              Religious Society of Friends expanded and the journal reveals much
              of the customs and practices of the Quakers in the Delaware Valley
              in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

              Hunt’s journal is not myopically focused on personal or even
              Quaker concerns; Hunt also records information about his wider
              world. In 1798, for instance, he noted, “We hear that the yellow
              fever is very mortal in Philadelphia and that the greater part of
              the inhabitants is fled and that it is in Burlington and likewise
              in New York they are moving out and that it is at Morris’s River
              very mortal – twelve died in eleven days. And we hear that divers
              have died on the highways, in the wood, barns and at Moorestown
              several were buried last week with the disorder.” A constant theme
              in Hunt’s writing is, in fact, the fragility of life; stories of
              thunder (lightning) strikes, fires, drownings, sickness, and other
              mortal disasters are all duly noted. While Hunt made no reference
              to the issues behind the American Revolution, he did write that
              the soldiers occupied his meetinghouse several times and used it
              as a hospital. The armies attempted to impress Quaker wagons for
              the use of the troops. The sounds of the Battle of the Brandywine
              (fought in Chester County, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1777) and
              the Battle of Germantown (north of Philadelphia) were heard in New
              Jersey. Later the sounds of soldiers marching could be heard in
              the meetinghouse.{" "}

              Why keep a journal? Hunt explained his resolve in the very first
              entry: “1770 The first of the 7th month, being near about the
              thirtieth year of my age, I began to keep a journal, or daily
              account of things that seemed worthy of my remembrance. Went to
              our meeting and Elisabeth Smith was there. Her text was: Teach me

              every day, although a day required but a line; he said many

              religious book if they met with passages that feelingly or
              livingly impressed their minds to make a note of it for he says

              Hunt recorded his journal in a series of small stitched booklets
              (most without boards) of various sizes. Sometimes he also kept
              note of his thoughts on loose sheets of paper. His writing was
              crowded and he made notes in the margins, frequently in the left
              for weather and the right for postscripts. As stated previously,
              Hunt also used the journal to record details about his joinery

              An abstracted version of Hunt’s journal was published by John

              second William (1776-1778) -- died in infancy. The others all
              lived into adulthood. John Hunt’s journal, like other journals of
              the time, did not sketch out in detail his home life, but there
              were numerous references to working with his male children and to
              his wife Esther accompanying him on his many travels to meetings.
              Esther supported John Hunt in his speaking in meeting. Abigail,
              who frequently accompanied her father on his travels, spoke in
              meeting, and, in March 1818, accompanied him to Select Meeting for
              the first time. Despite the lack of descriptive detail, the Hunt
              family frequently worked and traveled together. &nbsp;The

              his sons. In August of 1819, for instance, he wrote, “I have not
              earned so much money in a day for several years past.”

              John Hunt was acknowledged as a minister in 1783 by Evesham
              Monthly Meeting. Quaker ministers were lay men and women who were
              recognized as being unusually inspired by the Spirit of God and
              provided most of the vocal messages in meeting for worship. They
              were not ordained but were formally designated or “recorded” by
              the monthly meeting. Regular meetings of ministers and elders,
              called “preparative meetings of ministers and elders,” or “select
              meetings,” were held to consider the spiritual life of the
              meeting.{" "}

              These gatherings were called “select” as only ministers and elders

              acted together in the select meetings.{" "}

              Ministers who discerned that it was their duty to travel outside

              certificate, basically a letter of introduction, signed by members
              of the monthly meeting attesting to their suitability. These
              travelling ministers were the glue that held the Quaker world
              together. They visited families and meetings in America and abroad
              as they felt “led by the spirit”.{" "}

              other people that he dealt with in his daily life. The quality of
              their testimony was a common theme in his journal. Richard Jordan
              (1756-1826), for instance, began to speak in the ministry after
              1781 and travelled widely. He was an active anti-slavery advocate
              and also gave up the habit of smoking tobacco. John Hunt first met
              Jordan as he was travelling in 1800 with his kinsman, Nathan Hunt.
              John Hunt spoke of Jordan’s testimony as “very lively and
              delivered with great force and strength.”

                      Kennedy &amp; Lucas in 1829; a later card photograph of
                      the print was taken and sold by Isaac G. Tyson after the
                      Civil War. On the back of the latter, four individuals
                      were identified: Benjamin Chew, John or Henry Drinker,
                      Robert Proud, and William Waring. The individual shown
                      second from the left is probably Joshua Evans as his
                      undyed attire was characteristic; it is interesting that
                      the artist chose to picture him coming face-to-face with
                      Chew, a birthright Friend who had been previously disowned
                      and is dressed in a more fashionable jacket. All would

              Evans avoided tea, coffee, sugar and molasses, and meat, and used
              only leather made from animals that had died naturally. Like John
              Woolman, he wore undyed clothing, dye being made by slave labor.
              This behavior caused some concern among Friends because
              “singularity” — acting in a manner that was more extreme — could
              be a source of undue pride. When Evans began to cultivate a long
              beard, his cumulative behaviors resulted in the appointment of a
              Select committee. Apparently Hunt supported Evans’ testimony. He
              wrote: “many of his Friends became uneasy; apprehending he was
              running beyond the motions of truth into unprofitable
              imaginations. They highly esteemed him before, and now extended to
              him their earnest admonitions.”

              John Parrish (1729-1807), another well beloved friend, was a
              Quaker abolitionist and a proponent of Native American rights.
              Parrish is best remembered for authoring "Remarks on the Slavery
              of the Black People." Published in 1806, Parrish's pamphlet
              covered such issues as Biblical anti slavery, constitutional
              rationales for emancipation, colonization, and African-American
              political protest. At Parrish’s death Hunt remarked that their
              acquaintance had begun before 1772 and that he usually stayed with
              him in Philadelphia during Yearly Meeting, “very pleasant and

              &nbsp;Plainness was a testimony that went beyond clothing and

              Quaker dress was readily identifiable by Quakers and non-Quakers
              alike. But there were no detailed written instructions to say what
              was plain and what was not. The cut of men’s coats and the style
              of women’s bonnets became Quaker convention. Friends were left to
              discern what was plain and what was worldly, and practice varied
              over a wide spectrum of behavior. Could Friends wear metal shoe
              buckles, when a string would do? As an acknowledged minister,
              Hunt, more than most Friends, needed to set an example for himself
              and the wider community. In 1785 he noted Jacob Lindley’s speaking
              on the subject of Friends wearing “carved silver [shoe] buckles
              and red, spotted handkerchiefs.”

              that it could fuel individual pride. This is something that John
              Woolman struggled with. It was also something that the committee

              “this afternoon, fourth hour, was appointed to meet at the burial

              Quakers were pioneers in the anti-slavery movement. Nevertheless
              it took several decades for Friends as a corporate body to reach
              the position that enslavement in any and all forms was
              incompatible with Quakerism and to finally require that all
              enslaved people held by Friends be liberated and that any Friend
              who refused to do so would be disowned. By 1780, slavery was
              virtually extinct among Friends. New Jersey nurtured the growing
              anti-slavery movement among Friends. John Woolman (1720-1772),
              David Cooper (1725-1795) and Joshua Evans (1731-1798) were among
              the most vocal proponents.{" "}

              that have slaves, in order if possible, to convince them of the

              We attended the school house meeting appointed for the black
              people, and a favored good time it was. A week after this we were
              at Evesham, and had a meeting with the black people there. In both

              Membership in the Society of Friends was not quickly or easily
              granted to African Americans. John Hunt was among those who
              advocated for equal access to membership. During the Yearly
              Meeting of 1796 he recorded:{" "}

              I was on several committees; one was concerning a case brought
              from Rahway, of a mulatto woman that had requested to be received
              amongst Friends; and of whom they gave a very favorable account,
              but could not unite in receiving her, on account of her color; so
              they brought the case to this Yearly Meeting….and it was
              unanimously agreed that there never was any discipline amongst
              Friends, to prohibit any from being received into membership on
              account of color or nation, whatsoever. We therefore reported to
              the Yearly Meeting, that monthly meetings should be considered at
              liberty to receive all such, when they were convinced of their
              sincerity, without distinction of nation or color: with which the
              meeting very heartily united. There was that felt which raised the
              testimony in this respect, above all opposition: notwithstanding
              the spirit of prejudice which had been imbibed on account of
              color, had kept it back above twenty years; within which time,
              divers black and mulatto people have requested to have a right

              Books were important to John Hunt. When he began his journal in
              1770, he gave his model as a passage from the writings of
              prominent Quaker leader William Penn’s (1644-1722). Especially in
              his latter years, he frequently read and commented on passages.

              The most used text was the Bible (King James Version) which Hunt
              quoted or paraphrased, often referring to a specific chapter and
              verse. Where Hunt does not provide a citation, we have footnoted
              the Bible chapter and verse. Hunt read widely in the Bible, from
              Genesis to the Book of Revelations. Robert Aitken printed a Bible
              in Philadelphia in 1782. And Isaac Collins published his “family
              bible” in Trenton in 1791. English Bibles belonging to Quaker
              families were also imported from London, Dublin, and Edinburgh.

              He read avidly. In the latter part of the journal he copied long
              passages about his readings or copied sections in their entirety,
              using his journal as a sort of commonplace book of significant
              works; this was also the time of his life when age limited his
              mobility. Most of his reading was in Quaker books, from the
              origins of the Society of Friends in the mid 1600s to contemporary
              works published in the early 19th century. Quaker books are here
              identified as books written by Quakers, and usually published by
              Quaker printers in North America and Britain. Many of these books
              were reprinted several times. A few books he purchased, some were
              given to him, and very likely he had access to well stocked
              meeting or subscription libraries. A Moorestown Library Company
              was organized in May of 1808 with Quakers John Kaighn and Hugh
              Hollingshead as its first President and Secretary.{" "}

              His interest was in religious texts. He either did not read, or
              did not comment upon in his journal, on secular works, nor did he
              seem to have had an interest in political questions. A Quaker
              minister of this time would have been unlikely to have been
              reading literature, but many Quakers did write on science, or
              botany. If Hunt read about botany or science he does not mention
              it in his journal.{" "}

              Not all “Quaker” books had Quaker authors. Hunt cited works by
              Francois Fenelon, William Law, and Thomas à Kempis. Fenelon
              (1651-1715) was a French Roman Catholic archbishop, theologian,
              and writer; he crossed Louis XIV because Fenelon espoused Quietist
              views and defended human rights. Law (1686-1761), an Anglican
              curate, was known for his personal integrity and theological
              writings; he wrote that every day should be viewed as a day of
              humility. Á Kempis (d. 1471), another Catholic priest, wrote{" "}

              Hunt occasionally came across newspapers like the{" "}

              . More often than not he found or was given individual copies by
              friends. To Hunt’s eye newspapers were full of news of disasters:
              earthquakes, famine, shipwreck, and disease. His own journal was
              filled with similar stories of the Yellow Fever epidemics, disease
              and crop failures. While life may not have been quite so dire as
              Hunt sometimes imagined, the risk of his family or his neighbors
              falling victim to accident or disease was a very real possibility.{" "}

                &nbsp;It is common to distinguish between Meetings for Worship
                and Meetings for Business, but John Hunt likely considered all
                meetings to be meetings for worship. &nbsp;See Appendix B for a
                more detailed explanation of the structure of the Society of
                Friends in Philadelphia Yearly Meeting during the late 18th and
