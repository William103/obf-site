              participated in seven or eight Quaker meetings each month; after

              even my wife would detest and abhor me (which I believe was the
              works of the enemy) for I found it quite otherwise for my wife

              me. But an healing peace followed of was such a reward of
              confirmation that I have thought since it never would be erased
              come on me what will or may.

              John Hunt was acknowledged as a minister in 1783 by Evesham
              Monthly Meeting. Quaker ministers were lay men and women who were
              recognized as being unusually inspired by the Spirit of God and
              provided most of the vocal messages in meeting for worship. They
              were not ordained but were formally designated or “recorded” by
              the monthly meeting. Regular meetings of ministers and elders,
              called “preparative meetings of ministers and elders,” or “select
              meetings,” were held to consider the spiritual life of the
              meeting.{" "}

            <span class="c7">
              These gatherings were called “select” as only ministers and elders
              could participate. Unlike the meetings for business, men and women
              acted together in the select meetings.{" "}

              Ministers who discerned that it was their duty to travel outside
              of their own neighborhood in “Truth’s service” obtained a
              certificate, basically a letter of introduction, signed by members
              of the monthly meeting attesting to their suitability. These
              travelling ministers were the glue that held the Quaker world
              together. They visited families and meetings in America and abroad
              as they felt “led by the spirit”.{" "}
