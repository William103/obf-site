              The remembrance of this our beloved friend, being precious amongst
              us, it is apprehended a brief account of him may be useful to
              survivors. &nbsp;

              It appear from memorandum which he left, that in his youth he was
              much inclined to vanity; but by yielding obedience to the
              “reproofs of instruction, which are the way of life,” he was
              induced to withdraw from such company as he had found to have a
              corrupting tendency; and by attention to this principle of divine
              grace, he was led to seek retirement, wherein his good desires
              were strengthened. &nbsp;He also found much consolation and
              encouragement in reading the scriptures and other religious books.
              &nbsp;Being careful diligently to attend meetings, his mind became
              exercised under an apprehension of duty to express a few words
              therein; and having at length yielded to these impressions, he
              experienced the reward of peace; and the expansion of his mind was
              such, that he felt love to flow toward all mankind in a manner he
              had never before witnessed. &nbsp;But when he again felt his mind
              drawn to a similar discharge of duty, he was induced to look for a
              greater evidence of its being a divine requiring, and to put it
              off from time to time for nearly a year, much to his own
              disadvantage. &nbsp;At length he gave up to the service, and
              continued to be engaged therein to the close of his days, being a
              minister about fifty years; and tho' his gospel labours were much
              about home, and at the neighbouring meetings, yet he made divers
              religious visits to Friends within the compass of our own, and the
              adjacent Yearly Meetings, to satisfaction.

              Being an example of plainness and simplicity, he also bore a
              public testimony against pride and superfluity, which he observed
              had increased to an alarming degree; frequently reviving the
              testimony of William Penn's father, viz. &nbsp;“Son William, if
              you and your friends keep to your plain way of preaching, and
              plain way of living you will make an end of the priests to the end
              of the world."

              His concern for the promotion of temperance often induced him to
              labour with Friends and others, to discourage the customary use of
              ardent spirits.

              His care for the rising generation led him frequently to visit
              schools, and on other occasions to use his endeavours to impress
              upon the minds of young people, the necessity of circumspection
              and watchfulness, That they might exercise a guarded care against
              the encroachments of corrupting customs and fashions: often
              expressing his anxiety that all might be excited to diligence in
              their respective duties, and to a due consideration of their
              latter end. &nbsp;His care to provide for his family, his punctual
              observance of contracts, and regular attention to engagements of a
              pecuniary nature, were evidences that he was governed by honest
              and upright principles. &nbsp;His diligence in attending religious
              meetings, his visits to those in affliction, his frequent
              religious labours at funerals, and at appointed meetings in places
              where they were not regularly held, manifested his ardent
              solicitude to be faithful in the discharge of his religious
              obligations. &nbsp;His gift in the ministry seemed to brighten
              near his close, directing all carefully to attend to "the
              unspeakable gift," or "light of Christ" in man, as being the only
              way to salvation; and which agrees also with Paul's testimony,
              "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
              men, teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
              should live soberly, righteously and godly, in this present
              world." And he frequently revived this observation, "That society
              or people which does not often recur to first principles will
              surely go to decay."

              As a man, his passions were easily excited under cross
              occurrences; which, for want of a constant watch, sometimes
              prevailed so as to occasion subsequent distress and heart-felt
              sorrow. &nbsp;But at length he was mercifully favoured to
              experience, in respect to this "thorn in the flesh," the
              sufficiency of that grace which is perfect even in weakness.
              &nbsp;A few years before his death, a friend who had been with him
              through the night, encouraged him to seek after an increase of
              patience; in tears he exclaimed, "why this has always been my
              weakness, but I have, prayed unto the Lord and he has helped me."

              He was diligent and industrious, both in his domestic and
              religious services; and so intent was his mind on laying up
              treasure in heaven, and availing himself of the means of
              improvement, that in accordance with the advice of William Penn to
              his children, he kept a diary for more than forty years; besides
              which, he wrote several essays and many letters on moral and
              religious subjects, evincing his concern for the promotion of
              truth and righteousness amongst his fellow-creatures.

          <p class="c14">
            <span class="c41 c60">
              Though often labouring under bodily infirmities, he was generally
              able to attend meetings till near his close; and zealously
              encouraged others to faithfulness in the discharge of this duty,
              particularly in that part of the week wherein so much deficiency
              has been observed.

          <p class="c14">
            <span class="c41 c60">
              During his last illness he manifested much resignation, often
              saying "he hoped he might be enabled to bear patiently what the
              Lord might see meet to inflict." A friend calling to see him,
              observed he was sorry to find him so ill. &nbsp;He replied, "I
              have enjoyed more days of health than many have had;" and spoke of
              his dissolution with great composure; saying, "the words of John
              Woolman often occur, My dependence is on the Lord, who I trust,
              will forgive my sins, which is all I hope for." Thus, we have
              reason to believe he was favoured to witness redemption through
              Christ the eternal Word, and no doubt gained an admittance into
              that kingdom, where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the
              weary be at rest.
