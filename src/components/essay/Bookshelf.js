              Books were important to John Hunt. When he began his journal in
              1770, he gave his model as a passage from the writings of
              prominent Quaker leader William Penn’s (1644-1722). Especially in
              his latter years, he frequently read and commented on passages.

            <span class="c10">
              The most used text was the Bible (King James Version) which Hunt
              quoted or paraphrased, often referring to a specific chapter and
              verse. Where Hunt does not provide a citation, we have footnoted
              the Bible chapter and verse. Hunt read widely in the Bible, from
              Genesis to the Book of Revelations. Robert Aitken printed a Bible
              in Philadelphia in 1782. And Isaac Collins published his “family
              bible” in Trenton in 1791. English Bibles belonging to Quaker
              families were also imported from London, Dublin, and Edinburgh.
              Hunt used Alexander Cruden’s{" "}

              He read avidly. In the latter part of the journal he copied long
              passages about his readings or copied sections in their entirety,
              using his journal as a sort of commonplace book of significant
              works; this was also the time of his life when age limited his
              mobility. Most of his reading was in Quaker books, from the
              origins of the Society of Friends in the mid 1600s to contemporary
              works published in the early 19th century. Quaker books are here
              identified as books written by Quakers, and usually published by
              Quaker printers in North America and Britain. Many of these books
              were reprinted several times. A few books he purchased, some were
              given to him, and very likely he had access to well stocked
              meeting or subscription libraries. A Moorestown Library Company
              was organized in May of 1808 with Quakers John Kaighn and Hugh
              Hollingshead as its first President and Secretary.{" "}

              His interest was in religious texts. He either did not read, or
              did not comment upon in his journal, on secular works, nor did he
              seem to have had an interest in political questions. A Quaker
              minister of this time would have been unlikely to have been
              reading literature, but many Quakers did write on science, or
              botany. If Hunt read about botany or science he does not mention
              it in his journal.{" "}

              Not all “Quaker” books had Quaker authors. Hunt cited works by
              Francois Fenelon, William Law, and Thomas à Kempis. Fenelon
              (1651-1715) was a French Roman Catholic archbishop, theologian,
              and writer; he crossed Louis XIV because Fenelon espoused Quietist
              views and defended human rights. Law (1686-1761), an Anglican
              curate, was known for his personal integrity and theological
              writings; he wrote that every day should be viewed as a day of
              humility. Á Kempis (d. 1471), another Catholic priest, wrote{" "}

            <span class="c10 c29">The Imitation of Christ</span>

              , a well-known book on devotion. Likely his copies were published
              by Quaker printers, such as Abraham Sherman Jr.,{" "}

              &nbsp;and Emmor Kimber, rather than that translated by Methodist
              leader John Wesley. Works by Law, Fenelon, and à Kempis were also
              listed in the Philadelphia Monthly Meetings’ library{" "}

              Hunt occasionally came across newspapers like the{" "}
            </span>
            <span class="c10 c29">Pennsylvania Gazette</span>
            <span class="c10">, the</span>

            <span class="c10">
              . More often than not he found or was given individual copies by
              friends. To Hunt’s eye newspapers were full of news of disasters:
              earthquakes, famine, shipwreck, and disease. His own journal was
              filled with similar stories of the Yellow Fever epidemics, disease
              and crop failures. While life may not have been quite so dire as
              Hunt sometimes imagined, the risk of his family or his neighbors
              falling victim to accident or disease was a very real possibility.{" "}

                &nbsp;It is common to distinguish between Meetings for Worship
                and Meetings for Business, but John Hunt likely considered all
                meetings to be meetings for worship. &nbsp;See Appendix B for a
                more detailed explanation of the structure of the Society of
                Friends in Philadelphia Yearly Meeting during the late 18th and
