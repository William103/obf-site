              Why keep a journal? Hunt explained his resolve in the very first
              entry: “1770 The first of the 7th month, being near about the
              thirtieth year of my age, I began to keep a journal, or daily
              account of things that seemed worthy of my remembrance. Went to
              our meeting and Elisabeth Smith was there. Her text was: Teach me
              to number my days so I may incline my heart to wisdom.”

              &nbsp;In 1814 he continued, “This Advice of William Penn to His
              Children of keeping a common-place book, etc., and to keep an
              account of every day, though a day should require but a line – he
              said many advantages flow from it, was what first put me upon thus
              keeping such a common-place book, as he calls it, nearly in my
              first beginning with it.”

              be done; so much time for yourselves, be it for study, walking,
              visit, &amp;c. In this be first, and let your friends know it, and
              you will cut off many impertinences and interruptions, and save a
              trouble of times for yourselves, which people most unaccountably
              lavish away. And to be more exact, (for much lies in this) keep a
              short journal of your time, though a day require but a line; many
              advantages flow from it.”

              Other Quakers approved of his efforts. “My dear cousin William
              Hunt was here and I shewed it to him and he seemed much pleased
              with and encouraged me in it and once in company with Anthony
              Benezet he told me I should keep such a book, and I told him I
              did, and he seemed pleased to hear it, very much encouraged it.
              But sometimes I am ready to think of burning it all, as some have
              done in times of poverty. But sometimes it seems very agreeable to
              look over it."

              But Hunt was not immune to inconsistency: “I have some weeks past
              neglected to continue my diary and concluded to drop it thinking
              maybe I had done enough if not too much at it but upon trial feel
              not quite easy. Remember what first put me upon it was William
              Penn’s advice to his children, which was to keep an account of
              every day, although a day required but a line; he said many
              advantages flowed from it, and further he advised them to keep a
              commonplace book and when they read the scriptures or any
              religious book if they met with passages that feelingly or
              livingly impressed their minds to make a note of it for he says
              these openings and impressions come not in the will of man no more
              than the Scriptures did to the inspired penmen and he says they
              may be lost through carelessness or overgrowing cares of the
              world. I believe it has been something like putting wood upon the
              altar to keep the fire burning as we read in Scripture for Solomon

              Hunt recorded his journal in a series of small stitched booklets
              (most without boards) of various sizes. Sometimes he also kept
              note of his thoughts on loose sheets of paper. His writing was
              crowded and he made notes in the margins, frequently in the left
              for weather and the right for postscripts. As stated previously,
              Hunt also used the journal to record details about his joinery
              business, and it functioned as an account book indicating details
              of the work performed and the payment received.

              Who were the intended readers of John Hunt’s journal? It seems
              unlikely that Hunt would have thought the entries for his working
              life interesting or significant for other readers. Moreover, in
              the early part of the journal, a number of his comments on his own
              spiritual state and ministry, and the spiritual state of his
              meetings, were coded.{" "}

              An abstracted version of Hunt’s journal was published by John
              Comly in 1837, thirteen years after Hunt’s death. In 1827-1828,
              Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, like most of the rest of the meetings
              in North America, split into Hicksite and Orthodox factions.{" "}
