              It is clear that Hunt respected and admired fellow ministers and
              other people that he dealt with in his daily life. The quality of
              their testimony was a common theme in his journal. Richard Jordan
              (1756-1826), for instance, began to speak in the ministry after
              1781 and travelled widely. He was an active anti-slavery advocate
              and also gave up the habit of smoking tobacco. John Hunt first met
              Jordan as he was travelling in 1800 with his kinsman, Nathan Hunt.
              John Hunt spoke of Jordan’s testimony as “very lively and
              delivered with great force and strength.”

              However, there were a few individuals who merited descriptives of
              “dear” or “near.” Of these Joshua Evans, Joshua Lippincott, and
              John Parrish were among those singled out. It is clear that John
              Hunt greatly esteemed fellow minister Joshua Evans (1731-1798) of
              Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. Evans was a frequent companion and

                      “A Monday Morning View of Friends Meeting House and
                      Academy, Philadelphia, Forty Years Ago.” This lithograph
                      was originally drawn by W.L. Breton and produced by
                      Kennedy &amp; Lucas in 1829; a later card photograph of
                      the print was taken and sold by Isaac G. Tyson after the
                      Civil War. On the back of the latter, four individuals
                      were identified: Benjamin Chew, John or Henry Drinker,
                      Robert Proud, and William Waring. The individual shown
                      second from the left is probably Joshua Evans as his
                      undyed attire was characteristic; it is interesting that
                      the artist chose to picture him coming face-to-face with
                      Chew, a birthright Friend who had been previously disowned

              Evans avoided tea, coffee, sugar and molasses, and meat, and used
              only leather made from animals that had died naturally. Like John
              Woolman, he wore undyed clothing, dye being made by slave labor.
              This behavior caused some concern among Friends because
              “singularity” — acting in a manner that was more extreme — could
              be a source of undue pride. When Evans began to cultivate a long
              beard, his cumulative behaviors resulted in the appointment of a
              Select committee. Apparently Hunt supported Evans’ testimony. He
              wrote: “many of his Friends became uneasy; apprehending he was
              running beyond the motions of truth into unprofitable
              imaginations. They highly esteemed him before, and now extended to
              him their earnest admonitions.”

              John Parrish (1729-1807), another well beloved friend, was a
              Quaker abolitionist and a proponent of Native American rights.
              Parrish is best remembered for authoring "Remarks on the Slavery
              of the Black People." Published in 1806, Parrish's pamphlet
              covered such issues as Biblical anti slavery, constitutional
              rationales for emancipation, colonization, and African-American
              political protest. At Parrish’s death Hunt remarked that their
              acquaintance had begun before 1772 and that he usually stayed with
              him in Philadelphia during Yearly Meeting, “very pleasant and

              &nbsp;Plainness was a testimony that went beyond clothing and

              the “world’s people” were to be clear and truthful.

              Quaker dress was readily identifiable by Quakers and non-Quakers
              alike. But there were no detailed written instructions to say what
              was plain and what was not. The cut of men’s coats and the style
              of women’s bonnets became Quaker convention. Friends were left to
              discern what was plain and what was worldly, and practice varied
              over a wide spectrum of behavior. Could Friends wear metal shoe
              buckles, when a string would do? As an acknowledged minister,
              Hunt, more than most Friends, needed to set an example for himself
              and the wider community. In 1785 he noted Jacob Lindley’s speaking
              on the subject of Friends wearing “carved silver [shoe] buckles
              and red, spotted handkerchiefs.”

              that it could fuel individual pride. This is something that John
              Woolman struggled with. It was also something that the committee

              Americans and African-Americans. At Evans’ death he observed that
              “this afternoon, fourth hour, was appointed to meet at the burial

              Quakers were pioneers in the anti-slavery movement. Nevertheless
              it took several decades for Friends as a corporate body to reach
              the position that enslavement in any and all forms was
              incompatible with Quakerism and to finally require that all
              enslaved people held by Friends be liberated and that any Friend
              who refused to do so would be disowned. By 1780, slavery was
              virtually extinct among Friends. New Jersey nurtured the growing
              anti-slavery movement among Friends. John Woolman (1720-1772),
              David Cooper (1725-1795) and Joshua Evans (1731-1798) were among
              the most vocal proponents.{" "}

              that have slaves, in order if possible, to convince them of the

              Membership in the Society of Friends was not quickly or easily

              I was on several committees; one was concerning a case brought
              from Rahway, of a mulatto woman that had requested to be received
              amongst Friends; and of whom they gave a very favorable account,
              but could not unite in receiving her, on account of her color; so
              they brought the case to this Yearly Meeting….and it was
              unanimously agreed that there never was any discipline amongst
              Friends, to prohibit any from being received into membership on
              account of color or nation, whatsoever. We therefore reported to
              the Yearly Meeting, that monthly meetings should be considered at
              liberty to receive all such, when they were convinced of their
              sincerity, without distinction of nation or color: with which the
              meeting very heartily united. There was that felt which raised the
              testimony in this respect, above all opposition: notwithstanding
              the spirit of prejudice which had been imbibed on account of
              color, had kept it back above twenty years; within which time,
              divers black and mulatto people have requested to have a right
              among Friends; but till now have been put by, on account of their
              color.
