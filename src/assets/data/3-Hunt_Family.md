The oldest son of Robert and Abigail Hunt of Haddonfield Monthly Meeting, John was born in August of 1740. John’s mother died when he was very young and Robert then married a young widow, Martha Ward, in 1749. John Hunt was subsequently apprenticed to George Matlack (1717-1766), a Quaker carpenter in Evesham.

John Hunt suffered one great public embarrassment. He and Esther Warrington, daughter of Henry and Elizabeth (Bishop) Warrington, were married on March 17, 1763, under the care of Evesham Monthly Meeting. Their first child, William, was born on July 29, a scant 4-½ months after the marriage. John Hunt offered an acknowledgement to the Monthly Meeting. The apology was accepted, and John Lippincott was appointed to read it aloud at a “publick first day meeting” at Chester, John and Esther Warrington Hunt’s home meeting house. With this, the disciplinary act was concluded. By 1766, John was appointed as delegate to Salem Quarterly Meeting.

John and Esther Warrington Hunt had ten children between 1763 and 1785. Three – William (1763-1764), Rachel (1773-1775) and a second William (1776-1778) – died in infancy. The others all lived into adulthood. John Hunt’s journal, like other journals of the time, did not sketch out in detail his home life, but there were numerous references to working with his male children and to his wife Esther accompanying him on his many travels to meetings. Esther supported John Hunt in his speaking in meeting. Abigail, who frequently accompanied her father on his travels, spoke in meeting, and, in March 1818, accompanied him to Select Meeting for the first time. Despite the lack of descriptive detail, the Hunt family frequently worked and traveled together.  The children, even in their adult years, were referred to affectionately by their nicknames – “Samme” rather than Samuel and “Bennie” rather than Benjamin – suggesting a level of intimacy between Hunt and his children.

Hunt’s family connections extended far beyond his immediate kin. He was born into and married within a network of Quaker family relationships in southern New Jersey. John Hunt’s father, Robert, was a first cousin to John Woolman (1720-1772), journalist and minister.

Esther Hunt’s nephew, Abraham Warrington, married Rachel Evans, daughter of John Hunt’s friend and fellow minister, Joshua Evans. Other close connections included the Coles, Roberts, Haines, and numerous others.

 Disease was a common occurrence and likely to prove fatal. At times John Hunt secured the services of a French doctor from Philadelphia. Samme’s illnesses and death in 1791 were described in detail. While no details of the births of his children are given, the health of his wife, Esther, was a deep concern. 

When the longer manuscript journal resumed on July 8, 1812. Hunt was 72 and less active. He travelled less often in the ministry and began to write about his sons helping him rather than helping his sons. In August of 1819, for instance, he wrote, “I have not earned so much money in a day for several years past.” A year later he penned, “Got a fall from the top of the pump and I think I had like to have broke my arm.” Perhaps this fall ended his active working life since no more references to his working remain. He was always a reader, but in his older years often wrote lengthy commentaries on his reading.
