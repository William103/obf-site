Similar bodies were established by other American yearly meetings. Later, quarterly and monthly meetings appointed committees to assist Friends who encountered hardships due to their opposition to war and slavery.  The Meetings for Sufferings also maintained contact with their counterpart in London that had been organized in 1676.  The Meeting for Sufferings acted for the Yearly Meeting between sessions and later developed into Representative Meeting of the Yearly Meeting.</dd>

<dt id="Memorials">Memorials</dt>
<dd>On the death of a minister or other important member, the monthly meeting might prepare a brief biography testifying to the spiritual value of this life.

<dt id="Ministers">Ministers</dt>

Ministers were formally designated or “recorded” by the monthly meeting, and regular meetings of ministers and elders, called Preparative Meetings of Ministers and Elders or Select Meeting were held to consider the spiritual life of the meeting.

<dd>Traditionally, Quakers developed a series of specific practices, often called testimonies, that expressed ethical conduct of truthfulness, simplicity, equality, and peace.  Testimonies include rejection of oaths, use of “thee” and “thou” in speech, plain dress, refusal to take off hats to social superiors, equality of men and women, opposition to slavery, and refusal to bear arms.  Testimonies also can refer to official documents, frequently disownments and memorials, prepared by Quaker business meetings as part of what they considered witnessing to truth.</dd>

<dt id="Womens-meeting">Women’s meeting</dt>
<dd>Separate business meetings for women alongside the men’s meetings were held by preparative, monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings.  Women appointed representatives, communicated with other women’s meetings, granted or received certificates of removal, approved marriages for women members.  The men’s meeting rarely overruled the women’s meetings on removals, marriages or questions regarding matters of discipline.  Gradually, beginning late in the 19th century, men and women began meeting jointly to conduct business.</dd>
