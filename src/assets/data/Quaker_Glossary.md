Similar bodies were established by other American yearly meetings. Later, <a href="Quarterly-Meeting">quarterly</a> and <a href="Monthly-Meetings">monthly</a> meetings appointed committees to assist Friends who encountered hardships due to their opposition to war and slavery.  The Meetings for Sufferings also maintained contact with their counterpart in London that had been organized in 1676.  The Meeting for Sufferings acted for the Yearly Meeting between sessions and later developed into Representative Meeting of the Yearly Meeting.</dd>

<dt id="Memorials">Memorials</dt>
  <dd>On the death of a <a href="Ministers">minister</a> or other important member, the <a href="Monthly-Meetings">monthly meeting</a> might prepare a brief biography testifying to the spiritual value of this life.  The memorial was read at the monthly meeting and forwarded to the <a href="Quarterly-Meeting">
quarterly</a> and/or yearly meeting. Yearly Meetings also periodically published printed books of memorials, particularly in the second half of the 19th century.</dd>

<dt id="Ministers">Ministers</dt>
<dd>Historically, men and women who were recognized as being unusually inspired by the Spirit of God and provided most of the vocal messages in meeting for worship.  Ministers were formally designated or “recorded” by the <a href="Monthly-Meetings">monthly meeting</a>, and regular meetings of ministers and <a href="Elders">elders</a>, called Preparative Meetings of Ministers and Elders or <a href="Select-Meeting">Select Meeting</a> were held to consider the spiritual life of the meeting.  The practice of “recording” ministers has for the most part been discontinued today.</dd>
  
  <dt id="Monthly-Meetings">Monthly Meetings</dt>
<dd>The Monthly Meeting was the fundamental unit of Friends’ organization. It had responsibility for care of members, authorized <a href="Removal">removals</a> and marriages, maintained discipline, considered <a href="Queries">queries</a>, and reported regularly to the <a href="Quarterly-Meeting">quarterly meeting</a>. All business meetings (at all levels) were held in a spirit of worship, and so were in effect meetings for worship for conducting business. In theory, all members in good standing could participate in the monthly business sessions, but the representatives generally presented the business of the Preparative Meeting.</dd>

<dd>A set of questions, revised periodically, which were to be answered in writing by preparative, <a href="Monthly-Meetings">monthly</a>, and <a href="Quarterly-Meeting">quarterly</a> meetings and reported to the Yearly Meeting.  The queries concern conduct of individuals and practices of the meetings and provide one means of assuring uniformity in discipline.  <a href="Select-Meeting">Meetings of ministers and elders</a> also responded to queries.</dd>

<dt id="Removal">Removal</dt>
<dd>A certificate of removal is a document given to persons who are transferring their membership from one monthly meeting to another.  Their removal testifies that they are members in good standing with the meetings they are leaving.</dd>

<dt id="Select-Meeting">Select Meeting</dt>

<dt id="Testimonies">Testimonies</dt>
<dd>Traditionally, Quakers developed a series of specific practices, often called testimonies, that expressed ethical conduct of truthfulness, simplicity, equality, and peace.  Testimonies include rejection of oaths, use of “thee” and “thou” in speech, plain dress, refusal to take off hats to social superiors, equality of men and women, opposition to slavery, and refusal to bear arms.  Testimonies also can refer to official documents, frequently <a href="#Disownments">disownments</a> and <a href="Memorials">memorials</a>, prepared by Quaker business meetings as part of what they considered witnessing to truth.</dd>

<dt id="Traveling-certificate-or-minute">Traveling certificate or minute</dt>

<dt id="Womens-meeting">Women’s meeting</dt>
<dd>Separate business meetings for women alongside the men’s meetings were held by preparative, <a href="Monthly-Meetings">monthly</a>, <a href="Quarterly-Meeting">quarterly</a>, and yearly meetings.  Women appointed representatives, communicated with other women’s meetings, granted or received certificates of <a href="Removal">removal</a>, approved marriages for women members.  The men’s meeting rarely overruled the women’s meetings on removals, marriages or questions regarding matters of discipline.  Gradually, beginning late in the 19th century, men and women began meeting jointly to conduct business.</dd>
