# Glossary of Quaker Terms

Acknowledgement
: A formal, written statement of apology by an offending member to the meeting for having acted in a manner contrary to the rules of discipline.

Birthright member
: A person whose parents are both members of the Society of Friends, thus making the person a Friend from birth.

Certificate of Removal
: see under Removal. 

Convinced Friend
: A person who is not a birthright Friend who joins the Society. 

Disownment
: The involuntary termination of membership in a meeting, when a member of a meeting acts contrary to established discipline.  Reasons for disownment have changed over time, often reflecting contemporary societal mores.  Today, very few people are disowned. 

Elders
: A small group of men and women appointed to assist and also oversee the ministers.  There were monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings of ministers and elders to oversee the spiritual life of the Society of Friends.

Quarterly Meeting.  These meetings are under the jurisdiction of a yearly meeting.  Half-Yearly Meetings were established where distance between meetings made more frequent gathering difficult.

Indulged meeting
: A newly formed meeting for worship which requests and is granted the care and oversight of a local monthly meeting.

Laid down
: Term used to denote the official discontinuance of a meeting.

Meeting for Sufferings
: A committee first appointed in 1756 by Philadelphia Yearly Meeting to raise and administer relief to Friends who suffered distress as a result of Indian conflicts or governmental persecution.  Similar bodies were established by other American yearly meetings. Later, quarterly and monthly meetings appointed committees to assist Friends who encountered hardships due to their opposition to war and slavery.  The Meetings for Sufferings also maintained contact with their counterpart in London that had been organized in 1676.  The Meeting for Sufferings acted for the Yearly Meeting between sessions and later developed into Representative Meeting of the Yearly Meeting.

Memorials
: On the death of a minister or other important member, the monthly meeting might prepare a brief biography testifying to the spiritual value of this life.  The memorial was read at the monthly meeting and forwarded to the quarterly and/or yearly meeting. Yearly Meetings also periodically published printed books of memorials, particularly in the second half of the 19th century.

Ministers
: Historically, men and women who were recognized as being unusually inspired by the Spirit of God and provided most of the vocal messages in meeting for worship.  Ministers were formally designated or “recorded” by the monthly meeting, and regular meetings of ministers and elders, called Preparative Meetings of Ministers and Elders or Select Meeting were held to consider the spiritual life of the meeting.  The practice of “recording” ministers has for the most part been discontinued today.

Opportunity -- An opportunity for a religious visit to families or to speak in meeting for worship.

Overseer
: A member of committee of overseers responsible for the welfare and discipline of members of the monthly meeting.

Particular meeting
: A formally established meeting for worship under the care of a monthly meeting.

Queries
: A set of questions, revised periodically, which were to be answered in writing by preparative, monthly, and quarterly meetings and reported to the Yearly Meeting.  The queries concern conduct of individuals and practices of the meetings and provide one means of assuring uniformity in discipline.  Meetings of ministers and elders also responded to queries.

Removal
: A certificate of removal is a document given to persons who are transferring their membership from one monthly meeting to another.  Their removal testifies that they are members in good standing with the meetings they are leaving.

Select Meeting -- Select meetings were limited to designated participants. This usually refers to the meeting of ministers and elders.

Sitting -- A religious visit, generally to a family.

Testimonies
: Traditionally, Quakers developed a series of specific practices, often called testimonies, that expressed ethical conduct of truthfulness, simplicity, equality, and peace.  Testimonies include rejection of oaths, use of “thee” and “thou” in speech, plain dress, refusal to take off hats to social superiors, equality of men and women, opposition to slavery, and refusal to bear arms.  Testimonies also can refer to official documents, frequently disownments and memorials, prepared by Quaker business meetings as part of what they considered witnessing to truth.

Traveling certificate or minute
: A document issued by a meeting to a member in good standing (normally a recorded minister), allowing him or her to travel to other meetings to visit or preach. 

Women’s meeting
: Separate business meetings for women alongside the men’s meetings were held by preparative, monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings.  Women appointed representatives, communicated with other women’s meetings, granted or received certificates of removal, approved marriages for women members.  The men’s meeting rarely overruled the women’s meetings on removals, marriages or questions regarding matters of discipline.  Gradually, beginning late in the 19th century, men and women began meeting jointly to conduct business.
