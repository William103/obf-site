Following William Penn's advice, John Hunt kept a journal for over half a century, beginning in 1770 and ending shortly before his death in 1824. 

Swarthmore College initiated a project to collect these documents and serve them for historical research through the internet. There are multiple facets to this project, such as scanning the physical documents, transcribing them, researching the documents to make them as rich and informative as possible. But the facet which this repository is germane to is well-designed website that will make the documents available, but also visualize some characteristics of the journals, e.g. creating a force directed graph to visualize the referrences contained in these journals.
